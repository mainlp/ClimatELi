Chapter 2 Emissions Trends and Drivers

Executive Summary

Global net anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during the last decade (2010–2019) were higher than at any previous time in human history (high confidence). Since 2010, GHG emissions have continued to grow, reaching 59 ± 6.6 GtCO2-eq in 2019,1  but the average annual growth in the last decade (1.3%, 2010–2019) was lower than in the previous decade (2.1%, 2000–2009) (high confidence). Average annual GHG emissions were 56 ± 6.0 GtCO2-eq yr –1 for the decade 2010–2019 growing by about 9.1 GtCO2-eq yr–1 from the previous decade (2000–2009)  – the highest decadal average on record (high confidence). {2.2.2, Table 2.1, Figure 2.2, Figure 2.5}

Emissions growth has varied, but persisted across all groups of GHGs (high confidence). The average annual emission levels of the last decade (2010–2019) were higher than in any previous decade for each group of GHGs (high confidence). In 2019, CO2 emissions were 45 ± 5.5 GtCO2, 2  CH4 11 ± 3.2 GtCO2-eq, N2O 2.7 ± 1.6 GtCO2-eq and fluorinated gases (F-gases: HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) 1.4 ± 0.41 GtCO2-eq. Compared to 1990, the magnitude and speed of these increases differed across gases: CO2 from fossil fuel and industry (FFI) grew by 15 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (67%), CH4 by 2.4 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (29%), F-gases by 0.97 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (254%), and N2O by 0.65  GtCO2-eq  yr–1 (33%). CO2 emissions from net land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) have shown little long-term change, with large uncertainties preventing the detection of statistically significant trends. F-gases excluded from GHG emissions inventories such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons are about the same size as those included (high confidence). {2.2.1, 2.2.2, Table 2.1, Figures 2.2, 2.3 and 2.5}

Globally, gross domestic product (GDP) per  capita and population growth remained the strongest drivers of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the last decade (robust evidence, high agreement). Trends since 1990 continued in the years 2010 to 2019 with GDP per capita and population growth increasing emissions by 2.3% and 1.2% yr –1, respectively. This growth outpaced the reduction in the use of energy per unit of GDP (–2% yr–1, globally) as well as improvements in the carbon intensity of energy (–0.3% yr–1) (high confidence). {2.4.1, Figure 2.16}

The global COVID-19 pandemic led to a  steep drop in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel and industry (high confidence). Global CO2-FFI emissions dropped in 2020 by about 5.8% (5.1–6.3%) or about 2.2 (1.9–2.4) GtCO2 compared to 2019. Emissions, however, have rebounded globally by the end of December 2020 (medium confidence). {2.2.2, Figure 2.6}

Cumulative net CO2 emissions of the last decade (2010–2019) are about the same size as the remaining carbon budget for keeping warming to 1.5°C (medium confidence). Cumulative net CO2 emissions since 1850 are increasing at an accelerating rate: about 62% of total cumulative CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 occurred since 1970 (1500 ± 140 GtCO2); about 43% since 1990 (1000 ± 90 GtCO2); and about 17% since 2010 (410 ± 30 GtCO2). For comparison, the remaining carbon budget for keeping warming to 1.5°C with a 67% (50%) probability is about 400 (500) ± 220 GtCO2 (medium confidence). {2.2.2, Figure  2.7; AR6 WGI 5.5; AR6 WGI Table 5.8}

A growing number of countries have achieved GHG emission reductions longer than 10 years – a few at rates that are broadly consistent with climate change mitigation scenarios that limit warming to well below 2°C (high confidence). There are at least 18 countries that have reduced CO2 and GHG emissions for longer than 10 years. Reduction rates in a few countries have reached 4% in some years, in line with rates observed in pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%). However, the total reduction in annual GHG emissions of these countries is small (about 3.2 GtCO2-eq yr–1) compared to global emissions growth observed over the last decades. Complementary evidence suggests that countries have decoupled  territorial CO2  emissions from GDP, but fewer have decoupled consumptionbased emissions from GDP. This decoupling has mostly occurred in countries with high per capita GDP and high per capita CO2 emissions. {2.2.3, 2.3.3, Figure 2.11, Table 2.3, Table 2.4}

Consumption-based CO2 emissions in Developed Countries and the Asia and Pacific region are higher than in other regions (high confidence). In Developed Countries, consumptionbased CO2 emissions peaked at 15 GtCO2 in 2007, declining to about 13 GtCO2 in 2018. The Asia and Pacific region, with 52% of current global population, has become a major contributor to consumptionbased CO2 emission growth since 2000 (5.5% yr –1 for 2000–2018); it exceeded the Developed Countries region, which accounts for 16% of current global population, as the largest emitter of consumptionbased CO2. {2.3.2, Figure 2.14}

Carbon intensity improvements in the production of traded products have led to a net reduction in CO2 emissions embodied in international trade (robust evidence, high agreement). A  decrease in the carbon intensity of traded products has offset increased trade volumes between 2006 and 2016. Emissions embodied in internationally traded products depend on the composition of the global supply chain across sectors and countries and the respective carbon intensity of production processes (emissions per  unit of economic output). {2.3, 2.4}

Developed Countries tend to be net CO2 emission importers, whereas developing countries tend to be net emission exporters (robust evidence, high agreement). Net CO2 emission  transfers from developing to Developed Countries via global supply chains have decreased between 2006 and 2016. Between 2004 and 2011, CO2 emission embodied in trade between developing countries have more than doubled (from 0.47 to 1.1 Gt) with the centre of trade activities shifting from Europe to Asia. {2.3.4, Figure 2.15}

Emissions from developing countries have continued to grow, starting from a  low base of per  capita emissions and with a lower contribution to cumulative emissions than Developed Countries (robust evidence, high agreement). Average 2019 per  capita CO2-FFI emissions in three developing regions  – Africa (1.2  tCO2 per  capita), Asia and Pacific (4.4 tCO2 per  capita), and Latin America and Caribbean (2.7 tCO2 per capita) – remained less than half that of Developed Countries (9.5 tCO2 per capita) in 2019. CO2-FFI emissions in the three developing regions together grew by 26% between 2010 and 2019, compared to 260% between 1990 and 2010, while in Developed Countries emissions contracted by 9.9% between 2010 and 2019, and by 9.6% between 1990 and 2010. Historically, the three developing regions together contributed 28% to cumulative CO2-FFI emissions between 1850 and 2019, whereas Developed Countries contributed 57% and Least-Developed Countries contributed 0.4%. {2.2.3, Figures 2.9 and 2.10}
