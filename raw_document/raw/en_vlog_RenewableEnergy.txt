Renewable Energy and the Energy Transition

Germany is changing because of its energy transition
but what is energy transition really mean
why is it so important now
and where are the opportunities and challenges
we need energy in all areas of life
for transportation and as heat and electricity
today we get most of our energy from fossil fuels
but there are many arguments against the use of fossil fuels
two of the most important factors
since the beginning of industrialization
we burn more and more fossil fuels
releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide
this increases the greenhouse effect
which is causing the earth to heat up rapidly
we have induced manmade climate change
which dramatically changes our planets natural processes
and creates a number of problems
fossil fuels are finite
especially the amount of available oil our main energy resource is decreasing rapidly
there is still some oil left
but exploitation is becoming increasingly expensive unsafe and dangerous for the environment
both factors are exacerbated by rapid economic development in emerging countries
the result accelerated climate change and increasing resource scarcity
to curb this trend a massive shift in energy policy is essential
nuclear power is no solution
the catastrophe of Fukushima has shown this once again
Germany's energy transition involves two main changes
first a shift to renewable energy instead of fossil fuel
second a decrease in energy use through design technology and energy efficiency measures
let's take a closer look at these issues
renewable energy sources
this means the extraction of energy from materials that are not finite or that regenerate themselves
this can happen in large plants but also on a small scale in private households close to the consumer
wind turbines have rotors which are moved by the power of the wind
a generator then creates electricity
similar to wind power in hydroelectric power stations kinetic energy drives a generator which produces electricity
wave and tidal power plants use the natural movement of the sea
there are two major forms of solar energy
solar collectors heat a transmission medium with the sun's energy
on a small scale this includes hot water heaters for individual households
on a large scale concentrated solar power plants produce electricity
solar photovoltaic cells convert the sun's rays directly into electricity
these systems are often installed on rooftops
geothermal energy can also be absorbed by collectors
just a few metres below the earth's surface
the increased temperature can be high enough to supply the heating for private households
in regions with high underground temperatures electricity can also be generated in this way
biomass from animal and vegetable substances like organic waste from agriculture in households or specially grown energy crops can generate electricity or be converted into fuel
the fermentation of these substances produces methane gas which is transformed into electricity and heat in cogeneration plants
ethanol and biodiesel fuels can be produced with special energy crops
solid biomass is burned in order to generate heat or electricity
when burned plants only release the amount of co2 they have absorbed during their growth
thus the carbon balance is neutral
from the energy source to the consumer energy runs through various conversion processes
in each of these steps energy is lost
to increase energy efficiency means to minimize these losses
or in other words to win as much a net energy as possible from the original energy source
many losses in industry and households can be avoided
in electricity production and in many industries a great amount of heat is released as a by-product
heat and power cogeneration uses this energy to heat the surrounding community
old appliances with a high power demand can be exchanged for more efficient ones
this decreases power consumption and lowers costs for the consumer
just as important as increasing efficiency is the reduction of overall consumption
our way of life uses too much energy we need to conserve
the energy transition is a very complex challenge
what are the difficulties
the use of renewable energy can have negative ecological consequences
occasionally the interests of nature conservation conflict with the production of green power
wind and hydroelectric power plants may damage the habitats of birds and fish
for the cultivation of energy crops rainforests are cleared
this destroys valuable ecosystems and important natural carbon sinks and increases co2 emissions
energy crops are often grown on fields that previously grew food crops
this increases world food prices
residents in the vicinity of many power plants can complain about unsightly buildings and noise
at times state funding practices have been criticised
subsidies can hinder a complete restructuring and favor a few large energy producers
businesses and households often cannot afford the upfront costs of buying more efficient equipment
and sometimes it's very difficult for us to change our habits
the reliable and constant supply of green electricity is a major technical challenge
two points are particularly challenging
the structure of power grids and the storage of power
in Germany for example energy production and consumption are located in different regions
the largest supplier of renewable electricity wind power plants are mostly located in the north due to good climate conditions
much of the country's energy intensive industry however is located in the south
currently the power grid lacks the capability to transport enough energy from north to south
as a result energy often has to be bought from other sources
even though enough energy is actually produced
in addition renewable energy sources are heavily dependent on the weather
their output fluctuates in times when power plants achieve a high performance
for example when there is a strong wind
there's a lack of sufficient storage capacity for the energy surplus
pump storage stations are a way to store some electrical energy
but these storage facilities take a lot of space and a certain geography
at this time a well engineered storage technology that could
be implemented nationwide doesn't exist
a technical solution might be so-called smart grids
these intelligent power grids observe and link production storage and consumption of energy in a large integrated system
depending on the demand for energy at a certain time they can fine-tune energy production and moderate consumption
they balance fluctuations between energy supply and demand and integrate the many new decentralized producers into the power
grid
thus the energy supply becomes more efficient and more reliable
we see an energy transition is inevitable
the change to renewable energy definitely poses many challenges
but these are much smaller and easier to deal with than the consequences of continued reliance on fossil fuels
and the energy transition also offers enormous opportunity
the exploration and development of this new economic sector is creating many new jobs
we also reduce our dependence on oil and gas imports
with its energy transition Germany as well as other countries can play a leading role in developing new technologies
and can make an important contribution to shaping a sustainable future
