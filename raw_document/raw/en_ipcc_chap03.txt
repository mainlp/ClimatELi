Chapter 3 Mitigation Pathways Compatible with Long-term Goals

Executive Summary

Chapter 3 assesses the emissions pathways literature in order to identify their key characteristics (both in commonalities and differences) and to understand how societal choices may steer the system into a particular direction (high confidence). More than 2000 quantitative emissions pathways were submitted to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report AR6 scenarios database, out of which 1202 scenarios included sufficient information for assessing the associated warming consistent with WGI. Five Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) were selected, each emphasising a different scenario element as its defining feature: heavy reliance on renewables (IMPRen), strong emphasis on energy demand reductions (IMP-LD), extensive use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the energy and the industry sectors to achieve net negative emissions (IMP-Neg), mitigation in the context of broader sustainable development (IMPSP), and the implications of a less rapid and gradual strengthening of near-term mitigation actions (IMP-GS). {3.2, 3.3}

Pathways consistent with the implementation and extrapolation of countries’ implemented policies until the end of 2020 see greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reaching 54– 61 GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2030 and to 47–67 GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2050, leading to a median global warming of 2.2°C to 3.5°C by 2100 (medium confidence). These pathways consider policies at the time that they were developed. The Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) permit a more systematic assessment of future GHG emissions and their uncertainties than was possible in AR5. The main emissions drivers include growth in population, reaching  8.5–9.7 billion by 2050, and an increase in global GDP of 2.7–4.1% per year between 2015 and 2050. Final energy demand in the absence of any new climate policies is projected to grow to around 480–750 EJ yr–1 in 2050 (compared to around 390 EJ in 2015) (medium confidence). The highest emissions scenarios in the literature result in global warming of >5°C by 2100, based on assumptions of rapid economic growth and pervasive climate policy failures (high confidence). {3.3}

Many pathways in the literature show how to limit global warming compared to pre-industrial times to 2°C (>67%) with no overshoot or to limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot. The likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot has dropped in AR6 compared to the Special Report on Global Warming of  1.5°C (SR1.5) because global GHG emissions have risen since the time SR1.5 was published, leading to higher near-term emissions (2030) and higher cumulative CO2 emissions until the time of net zero (medium confidence). Only a small number of published pathways limit global warming to 1.5°C without overshoot over the course of the 21st century. {3.3, Annex III.II.3}

Cost-effective mitigation pathways assuming immediate action1 to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) are associated with net global GHG emissions of 30–49 GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2030 and 14–26 GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2050 (medium confidence). This corresponds to reductions, relative to 2019 levels, of 13–45% by 2030 and 52–76% by 2050. Pathways that limit global warming to below 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot require a further acceleration in the pace of the transformation, with net GHG emissions typically around 21–36 GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2030 and 1–15 GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2050; thus, reductions of 34–60% by 2030 and 73–98% by 2050 relative to 2019 levels. {3.3}

Pathways following Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) announced prior to COP262 until 2030 reach annual emissions of 47–57 GtCO2-eq by 2030, thereby making it impossible to limit warming to  1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and strongly increasing the challenge to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) (high confidence). A  high overshoot of  1.5°C increases the risks from climate impacts and increases the dependence on large-scale carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. A  future consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 implies higher fossil fuel deployment and lower reliance on low-carbon alternatives until 2030, compared to mitigation pathways with immediate action to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower. To limit warming to 2°C (>67%) after following the NDCs to 2030, the pace of global GHG emission reductions would need to accelerate rapidly from 2030 onward: to an average of 1.4–2.0 GtCO2-eq yr–1 between 2030 and 2050, which is around two-thirds of the global CO2 emission reductions in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and around 70% faster than in immediate action pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%). Accelerating emission reductions after following an NDC pathway to 2030 would be particularly challenging because of the continued buildup of fossil fuel infrastructure that would be expected to take place between now and 2030. {3.5, 4.2}

Pathways accelerating actions compared to NDCs announced prior to COP26 that reduce annual GHG emissions to 48  (38–52) GtCO2-eq by 2030, or  2–9 GtCO2-eq below projected emissions from fully implementing NDCs announced prior to COP26, reduce the mitigation challenge for limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) after 2030 (medium confidence). The accelerated action pathways are characterised by a  global, but regionally differentiated, roll out of regulatory and  pricing policies. Compared to NDCs, they see less fossil fuels  and more low-carbon fuels until 2030, and narrow, but do not close the gap to pathways assuming immediate global action using all available least-cost abatement options. All delayed or accelerated action pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) converge to a global mitigation regime at some point after 2030 by putting a significant value on reducing carbon and other GHG emissions in all sectors and regions. {3.5}

Mitigation pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot reach 50% reductions of CO2 in the 2030s, relative to 2019, then reduce emissions further to reach net zero CO2 emissions in the 2050s. Pathways limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) reach 50% reductions in the 2040s and net zero CO2 by 2070s (medium confidence). {3.3, CrossChapter Box 3 in this chapter}

Peak warming in mitigation pathways is determined by the cumulative net CO2 emissions until the time of net zero CO2 and the warming contribution of other GHGs and climate forcers at that time (high confidence). Cumulative net CO2 emissions from 2020 to the time of net zero CO2 are 510 (330–710) GtCO2 in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and 890 (640–1160) GtCO2 in pathways limiting warming to 2°C (>67%). These estimates are consistent with the assessment of remaining carbon budgets by WGI after adjusting for differences in peak warming levels. {3.3, Box 3.4}
