How [Climate Change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) Actually Works ... in [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4) [Minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute)
[Good Morning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_morning) John.
So [probably](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) you have [heard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing) that for a long time the [amount](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amount_of_substance) of [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) entering the [earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth) and the [amount](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amount_of_substance) leaving the [earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth) was about the same.
[And](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction) that was [good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good) because [if](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) those two [numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number) are not [equal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_(mathematics)) then we are either getting colder every [year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year) or we 're getting [hotter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) every [year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year).
But [now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present) it looks like there is in [fact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact) more [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) coming in than going out and that [results](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Result) in basically three [things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)).
First, more [heat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat).
[Which](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Which) is [what](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word) we call like [individual molecules moving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-molecule_experiment) [faster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration).
[Which](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Which) is [wild](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife).
Like, when you are [hot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) it is because the [molecules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) that make up your [body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body) are jiggling more.
Does n't seem [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality), but it is.
Second you have more [severe weather](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather), which is when a lot of [molecules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) together move around.
[And](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction) because of those two you have [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number) three which is [probably](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) the worst of them.
[Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity) are [different](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_(philosophy)).
That doesn't sound so bad except that we have [built](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction) a tremendous [amount](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity) of [our](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We) [human](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) [infrastructure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure) designed based on the [idea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea) that [things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity) will be roughly the [same](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy)) [now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present) as they were in [the past](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past), with regards to [rainfall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain) and [temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature) and [stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity) like that.
When that [stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity) [changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change) [crops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop) might have dramatically lower [yields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield), [resulting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Result) in very [hungry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger)  [people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People).
[People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People) might use their [air conditioners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning) way more than in [the past](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past) so entire [power grids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid) [fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure).
[Forests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest) that [grew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_development) in [areas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area) that once had shorter [dry seasons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_season) might [burn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn) up in [fires](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire).
So that's bad.
[And](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction) always the first [thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)) you should ask when something bad is happening is why is that happening?
So you [know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) when you [go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(verb)) outside [wearing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear) a black [t- shirt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt) you get [hotter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) [faster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration) then when you 're [wearing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear) a [white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White) [t- shirt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt).
That's because [things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)) only look [black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black) [if](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) they [absorb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)) all of the [visible light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) that is [hitting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_(attack)) [them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)).
[If](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_(preposition)) the [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) was not being [absorbed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)) it would either be [reflected](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)) as [white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White) [light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) or as a [mirror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror).
[Or](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Or) it would be clear, which would be a [strange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangeness) [choice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice) for a [shirt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirt).
So [if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_(preposition)) you're [wearing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear) a white [shirt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirt) the [visible light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) isn't being [absorbed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)), it's being [reflected](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)) and that's why you're less [hot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat).
[Absorb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)), [reflect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)), or let pass through that's basically the only three [things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)) that a [material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material) can do with [light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light).
[And](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction) [if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_(preposition)) [the light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) is being [absorbed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)), that means the [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) of [the light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) hit the [molecule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) in such a [way](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology) that it's [creating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create) [movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion) in the [molecule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule).
[The light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) no longer exists the [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) is [now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present) [movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion), and the [movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion) can [now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present) be transferred to other [elements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element).
Just like a [cue ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billiard_ball) [hitting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_(attack)) a [pool ball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billiard_ball).
There are basically two [ways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology) a [molecule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) can [heat up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) and we just talked about both of [them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology).
The first is that a [photon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) [travels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel) through [space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space) and then gets [absorbed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)) by a [molecule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) and [speeds up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration) that [molecule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule).
That's [heat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) from [radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation).
[And](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction) the second [way](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology) is that a [particle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle) that's jiggling a lot [hits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_(attack)) a [particle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle) that's jiggling less and [transfers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer) its [heat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) to that other [molecule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule).
When that happens in a [solid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid) we call it [conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction) and when it happens in [a fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid) we call it [convection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection).
So like when we are in the [shade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow) 99 [%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage) of the [heat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) you are feeling is [convection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection).
It's [molecules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) in the [air](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth) [running](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running) to you and [transferring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer) their [heat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) to you.
But when [you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You) 're in [the sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) it's a [mix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture) of both the [radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation) and the [convection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection), which is why it's [hotter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) in [the sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun).
[Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present), [different](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_(philosophy)) [molecules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) [absorb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)) [different](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_(philosophy)) [wavelengths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength) of [light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light).
Like this [book cover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_cover) is mostly [absorbing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)) [everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything) but [yellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow), and this one is mostly [absorbing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)) [everything](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything) but [red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red), and the [red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red) and the [yellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow) are being [reflected](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)) back.
[And](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And) this can also happen with [gasses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas).
There can be [green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green) [gasses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas) and [yellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow) [gasses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas) and [brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown) [gasses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas).
But the two [molecules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) of [interest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention) here, [carbon dioxide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) and [methane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane), they don't [absorb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)) any [light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) in the [visible spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum), which means that they are [clear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency).
We ca n't [see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception) them.
One of the [problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving) with [methane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane), actually.
[If](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_(preposition)) your [house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House) is [filling up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuffing) with it you [need](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need) to make sure that you [know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) that that's happening, but you ca n't [see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception) it.
But, at [certain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certainty) [infrared](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared) [wavelengths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength), which [the sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) [creates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity) a lot of, they are [black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black).
And when we put more of [them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength) in [the atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth), [our](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We) [atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere) is a little less [clear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency) in the [wavelengths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength) and a little more [black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black).
Those [molecules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) [absorb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)) [photons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) they start to move around [faster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration), they [knock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_(attack)) into other [molecules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule), which also start to move around [faster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration).
[They](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) push on each other more and more until [they](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) have lower [pressure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure) and that [hot air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) starts to rise.
[Cooler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature) [denser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density) [air](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere) rushes into take its [place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toponymy) and that's [weather](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather) [now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present).
Those [hot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) [air](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere) [molecules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) might remove more [moisture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisture) from the [soil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil) resulting in more [wildfires](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire).
It might [evaporate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation) more [water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water) from [the ocean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean) resulting in bigger [storms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm).
We know that this happens, we know how this happens, we know why this happens and we know [what](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word) the [effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change) are.
And we know that the only [way](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology) to stop it is for there to be more [co2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) and [methane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane) from [the atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth).
But that is a very hard [thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity) to do.
It 's very hard and [expensive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost) to [remove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_removal) those [things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) from [the atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth).
It's very hard and [expensive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost) to replace the [agriculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture) and [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) and [transportation infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport) that results in the [release of those gasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions).
It is not an easy [problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving) to [solve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving).
But we have a very strong grip on [what](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word) the [problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving) is.
[And](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction) I think people can basically [solve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving) any [problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving) [if only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_(preposition)) we can [agree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus) that it [exists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence).
John, I'll [see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception) you on [Tuesday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuesday).
