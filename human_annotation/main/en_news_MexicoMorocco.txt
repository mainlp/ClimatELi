Young indigenous women from [Mexico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico) and [Morocco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco) unite for [COP27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference)
[Descendants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descendants_(franchise)) of [indigenous peoples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples) join to fight for [climate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate)
When Fatima Zahrae Taribi, a 20-year-old [Moroccan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco) [climate justice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_justice) [advocate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocate), met Luz Edith Morales Jimenez, a [young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth) [land defender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_defender) from [Michoacán, Mexico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michoacán), she wondered how they could communicate.
Zahrae speaks [French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language), [Arabic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic), [and English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language), and Morales speaks [Spanish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language) and [Purépecha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pur%c3%a9pecha), an [indigenous language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_languages_of_the_Americas) from her [region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region).
Yet, when they met in a climate camp in [Tunisia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia) ahead of the [international climate conference COP27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference), [the UN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) 's annual international environmental conference, they [understood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding) each other without needing [words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word).
“The odd [thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)) was that I don't speak [Spanish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language) and they don't speak [English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language), so we had to figure out how to [communicate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication).
Like the [proverb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proverb) goes, actions speak [louder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness) than [words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word), and with them, our only option was to do actions together and speak through our [eyes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye) and [emotions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion).” Zahrae told [Global](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization) Voices through [Instagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram).
“I couldn't [believe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief) that we connected on such a deep level with no [words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word).”
Although [the Atlantic Ocean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean) separates these two [young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth) women of different indigenous [origins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology), they have [experienced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience) [comparable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparability) effects from [colonialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism), land [dispossession](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eviction), and [climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change).
Morales ' [father](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father), a [Purépecha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pur%c3%a9pecha) [indigenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples) [man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man) who [tried](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial) to protect their [ancestral lands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral_domain) from encroaching [development projects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_development) which would cut down [old-growth forests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/growth_forest) for the [monoculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoculture) of [avocados](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado), was shot and [killed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder) by [Mexican police](Federal_Police_(Mexico)) in 2017.
Three other people were [killed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder), and 10 were [tortured](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture).
Yet five years later, authorities have failed to deal with the [case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit).
Since then, his daughter has [fought](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat) for [justice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice).
Meanwhile, Zahrae comes from a long line of [indigenous](Indigenous_peoples) [Amazigh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers) [Moroccans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccans) who speak their own [language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language) but have endured [discriminatory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination) [policies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy) to make them [adhere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion) to “[Arabism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Arabism).”
For the [indigenous](Indigenous_peoples) [Amazigh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers) people, responding to the difficulties posed by [climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) might mean the difference between [life and death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_and_death) for entire [communities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community).
The use of [water-intensive industrial farming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_farming) [methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) has made the nation's limited [water resources](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources) more apparent.
As [food insecurity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security) and [water shortages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity) become more common, [officials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service) are struggling to find creative [solutions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving), which is particularly complicated in [Moroccan regions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco) where [indigenous people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples) are bound to the [land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land).
[Amazigh populations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers) must cope with difficulties like above-average [poverty rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty) and [prejudice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice), as well as more obvious environmental challenges like maintaining [forests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest) as structural [drought](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought) intensifies throughout the [Maghreb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb), [Sahel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel), and beyond as a result of the [climate crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis).
Zahrae 's [grandfather](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandparent) served as a land [custodian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_guardian) and devoted his life to defending the people 's [right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights) to their land from [French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) [colonists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settler).
Zahrae took up his mantle to [continue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuance) guarding the [land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land) after years of worsening [drought](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought).
“I [think](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought) of myself as a [continuation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation) of his soul, as I am a protector of the [land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land) against another enemy: [climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change),” Zahrae said.
[COP27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference) in [Sharm El Sheikh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharm_El_Sheikh)
The two young women met at the [Climate Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_justice) Camp in [Tunisia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia) earlier this year and reconnected at [COP27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference), which is being held in [Sharm-El-Sheik, Egypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharm_El_Sheikh), from November 6–18.
[COP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Climate_Change_conference) is [the United Nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) ' largest [international climate conference](United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference), bringing together [heads of state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state), [non- profit organizations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization) , [business](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business) [leaders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership), and [activists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activism) to take action toward achieving the [world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World) 's collective [climate goals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation) as agreed upon in the [2015 Paris Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) .
This [year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year) 's conference, [COP27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference), brings together over 190 [countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) against the [backdrop of global crises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change).
[Food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices) and [energy costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source) are at record highs as a result of [COVID - 19](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19) 's effects and [Russia 's invasion of Ukraine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine), and nearly every [region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region) of [the planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) is suffering extraordinary [climatic catastrophes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis), including record [rain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain), [heat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat), [fires](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire), and [storms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm).
The main [goals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal) of [COP27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference) include developing [financial plans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_plan) to address [climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) and lower [global temperatures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate) by at least 1.5 [degrees Celsius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius) through reductions in [greenhouse gas emissions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions).
[Indigenous peoples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples) ' role and burden in [mitigating climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation)
[Indigenous peoples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples) frequently pay a hefty [price](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price) for their unwavering [dedication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedication) to [the environment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism).
For Zahrae and Morales, [climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) is the [symptom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms) of ongoing structural [issues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_issue).
They both face “[racism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism), [gender violence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence), [extractivism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extractivism), and imposed [death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death),” Morales says through [WhatsApp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp).
“ [Indigenous communities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples) are always the ones who [preserve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_reserve) the [majority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority) of the diversity that [exists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence) on [the planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), without expecting anything in return.
We are [living](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life) [resistances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement) that have survived all the [mega - projects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaproject) of the big [cities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City) since [ancient times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history); we are the ones who give life and [safeguard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeguard) all that remains of [nature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature),” she continues.
She is [demanding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand) that [leaders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership) comply with their [promises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promise) toward [indigenous people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples).
More than 80 [percent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage) of the [world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World) 's [biodiversity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity) is [protected](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection) by [indigenous peoples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples) worldwide, despite their [estimated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation) five [percent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage) [population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population) share.
[Biodiversity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity) plays a crucial role in [mitigating climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation) and ensuring [human survival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_extinction).
Yet, [indigenous peoples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples) ' ongoing commitment to the [land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land) and [ecosystems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem) often [comes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comes) at a high [price](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price).
In [Latin America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America), [land defenders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_defender), who are often indigenous, are routinely [killed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder).
In 2021, 54 [land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_defender) and [environment defenders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_defender) have lost their [lives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life) in [Mexico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico), according to the [non- profit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization) [Global Witness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Witness).
“[Mexico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico) was the [country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) with the highest recorded [number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number) of killings, with defenders [killed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder) every [month](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month), totaling 54 killings in 2021, up from 30 the previous [year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year),” their most recent report reads.
Many more are [harassed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harassment), [criminalized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminalization), and [intimidated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation) by the government, [businesses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business), and other actors.
They are particularly at risk when opposing [mining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining) and [renewable energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy) [mega - projects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaproject) (such as large [wind farms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm) or [hydroelectric plants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity) ), [industrial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry) [monocultures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoculture), and other private or public [projects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project) that [threaten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat) their [communities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community), [forests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest), and [water sources](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply).
In [Northern Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa) and [the Middle East](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East), the challenges of [speaking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech) up for the [environment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment) and [climate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) often come with the [risk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk) of being [imprisoned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_prisoner) or [forcibly disappeared](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforced_disappearance).
In [Egypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt), for example, where the conference is held, 60,000 [political prisoners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_prisoner) are [estimated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation) to be [behind bars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison).
The [country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) has been [charged](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment) with preventing [environmental organizations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_environmental_organizations) from [conducting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting) independent [policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy), [advocacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy), and [fieldwork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_research) necessary to [safeguard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeguard) the [nation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation) 's [natural environment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment).
Despite having contributed the least to [global warming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) and [environmental degradation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation), [indigenous peoples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples) and other [historically](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History) [colonized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization) and [marginalized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion) peoples are at the [frontlines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_line) of [climate change effects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change).
[Advocates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocate) using the [term](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology) “[climate justice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_justice)” seek to rectify this unbalance.
[Ocean levels are rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise).
[Pollution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution), [extreme heat waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave), and [droughts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought) are [health](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health) and [crop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop) [hazards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard).
[Locals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locals) in both regions also point to the [hoarding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding) of [water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water) for [business](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business) or [political](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics) purposes, [leading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership) to conflict.
Women, in [particular](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particular), are at risk of [climate change vulnerability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_vulnerability) and [violence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence).
These are some of the factors that [motivate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation) Zahrae to [create](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity) a safer [environment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment) for [climate advocacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_movement).
“My first [step](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairs) was to figure out [ways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology) to make it [accessible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility), just, and [safe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety) for [individuals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual) to [advocate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy) for the cause they [believe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief) in.” 
Zaharae started [Moroccan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco) Youth for Change, a [community](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community) where [young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth) [Moroccans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco) may meet and talk about [issues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_issue) they are facing, such as [climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change).
Morales, on her part, is active in Futuros Indígenas ([indigenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples) [Futures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future) ), a network of [indigenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples) [activists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_movement) and [journalists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist) from [Mexico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico) and [Central America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America) who [empower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment) [indigenous people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples) to share their [own](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership) [narratives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative) about [climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change).
When asked about how women from the [Global South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_North_and_Global_South) can [leverage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(negotiation)) their [similar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity) [lived experiences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lived_experience), Morales says: “I have always [believed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief) that unity is strength.
We can take advantage of our shared [crises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis) to support each other.”
For Zahrae, meeting Morales and other [young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth) [climate activists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_movement) was key.
“Thanks to these people, my [hope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope) and trust in [humanity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) have been restored and I am able [now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present) to tackle the upcoming challenges with a [smile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile) on my [face](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face) and a serenity in my [heart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart).”
