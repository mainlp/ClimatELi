The Biggest [Climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate) Bill of Your [Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life) - But What does it DO !?
Good Morning John, Today, [Joe Biden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden) is probably going to sign the largest single piece of [climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) [legislation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation) any [country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) on [our planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) has ever [enacted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_(law)).
But everything I have [read](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading), AND I HAVE READ A LOT, is frustratingly thin on details.
And, as I began to do the [research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research) myself on that … I [discovered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)) why.
I have been going over [non-partisan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisanism) [analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis), [congressional budget office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office) reports, talking to the people who wrote those reports, talking to the [Administrator of the EPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_the_Environmental_Protection_Agency), even, in some cases, reading THE ACTUAL TEXT OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED PAGE BILL and [what](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word) I have found has been a surprise … but also … a bit of a [delight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness).
So let's start at the beginning.
“This is the beginning, the beginning …”
Around 4 [billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion) [years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year), something started to be [alive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life) on [earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) and, ever since then, that life has had a profound effect on [the planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth).
[Photosynthesizers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis) used [sunlight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight) to break up [Carbon Dioxide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide), [build](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction) their bodies out of the [carbon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon) and release the [oxygen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen).
That [oxygen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen) made all [kinds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_kind) of [interesting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_(emotion)) weird [things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)) happen, including, at one point, killing almost everything.
So, no, life creating [atmospheric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere) change that has a profound negative impact on life, not actually new.
Over time, life kept shoving [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) into carbon-containing [molecules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) and then, after the life died, those [molecules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) would break down and the [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) would be re-released.
but sometimes the [molecules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) of [the dead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death) [thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)) would stay [trapped](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapping) and they wouldn't break down and they would get stuck in [the earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) where they 'd [heat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) up and get squished and become [coal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal), or [oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum), or [natural gas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas).
All of that [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) emitted by [the sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun), grabbed by life, and then [stored](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_storage) by [the earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), waiting there to power your [car](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car) or your [refrigerator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator) or your [microsoft zune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune).
That [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) is [what](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word) has powered so much of our [modern lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernity).
but as we have released that [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) to do things with, we have also released the original [molecules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) that it was [stored](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_storage) inside of.
Those complicated [carbon molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes_of_carbon) get broken down and [carbon dioxide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) gets released.
It is a [molecule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) that is [opaque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)) to a lot of [infrared radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared).
A [gas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas) that makes [our atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere) less clear to [heat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat).
And so [heat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) that would otherwise escape no longer is.
There is more [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) in [the atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth), and it's changing [weather patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather), increasing [droughts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought) and [fires](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire) and [storms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm) and [heat waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave).
But, unfortunately, we also really need all that [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) to prevent people from [dying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death) in [heat waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave).
To make the [food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food) people [eat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating), to move it around, to power [the plane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane) that takes me to visit my brother.
We ca n't just turn the [power plants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station) off, people would start [dying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death) really quickly, and they wouldn't stop for a really, really long time.
It's messy and it 's complex and, like those first [cyanobacteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria) people started to [wonder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_(emotion)) [if](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) we weren't [gonna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going-to_future) just [ruin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruins) it for ourselves.
But we are smarter than them and we are more capable of passing broad based [industrial policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_policy) with a focus on [clean energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy) than they are.
Barely … Just barely.
And that brings us up to [now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present).
([Music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music): “I'm so excited, And I just can't hide it … ” )
In 2005, a couple-a years before this [YouTube channel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube) began, [the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) hit peak [carbon emissions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions) of 7 [billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion) [tons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne) per year.
At the time, that [problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving) looked pretty insurmountable.
This is Jesse Jenkins one of the world's leading [experts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert) on modeling [decarbonization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation) efforts on those dark years.
Jesse Jenkins: Umm.. you [know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge).
At the time [if](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) could get a [wind farm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm) that cost less than [$](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar)100 a [megawatt hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour) – which is like triple the, you [know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) normal [electricity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity) rate that was a great deal.
And solar was ten times the [cost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost) of normal you [know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge), normal power from a [gas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas) line or something.
But over the last [decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade), due to solar policies in [the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) but also abroad, in, you [know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge), [China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) and [Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) and [Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan) and elsewhere – we've taken these, [what](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word) used to be called expensive [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) [technologies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) that at the time people were worried we couldn't get, you [know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) – 5 or 10 or 15 [percent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage) of our [electricity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity) from without blowing up the grid.
And [now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present), they're cheap [trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillion) [dollar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar) Mainstream [technologies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) that are Scaling rapidly, and are powering.
In the case of some parts of the [country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state), The majority of the [electricity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity) on [Certain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certainty) [days](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day).
Hank: I'm in [what](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word) seems to be a weird [situation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom) of being more [optimistic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism) [now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present) than I was 20 [years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year) because, in that time, I have seen a LOT of change.
Since this [YouTube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube) channel began we have dropped from 7 [billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion) [tons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton) to 5 [billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion) [tons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton) emitted per year in [the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).
In the next 15 years, according to Jesse's models which are admittedly trying to predict [the future](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future) we will [probably](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) get down to – 3.5 [billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion) [tons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton), 50[%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage) below our peak.
This [week](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week) I was able to talk to [Michael Regan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_S%2e_Regan), the head of the [EPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency) and he also talked about this [optimism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism).
Administrator [Regan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_S%2e_Regan): Even when I talked to [past](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past) [EPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency) Administrators, the role [technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) plays in the [solutions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving) that we're seeking, the quickness of [innovation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation) and the [evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) of [business](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business) models, matching with [technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) and [science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) and [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data).
We can move much faster than we've ever We've ever moved before.
Hank: we are aiming for [net zero emissions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality) in [America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) by [2050](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3rd_millennium).
And this is the first time in my life that I have felt like that might be [possible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_possibility).
We have never undergone a shift in [energy use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_consumption) that is anything like this.
Maybe the original [electrification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification) of the [country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) – but we're gonna have to make this shift a lot faster than we made that shift.
However complex you think it is, it is more complex than that.
It's the case even for [experts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert).
We only get to see our [own](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership) little corner of what's going on.
This is a big [problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving) that no one [person](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person) understands all of.
But in this [video](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video), you're going to go from [knowing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) more than 80 or 90[%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage) of people about this stuff to [knowing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) more than 99[%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage) of people.
And it's only going to take you like 15 minutes.
So let's do this.
This [bill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_(law)) basically has three big [goals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal), And I don't see them being talked about.
So, here's the framework, With which to [understand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding) this.
One, we are trying to decrease the [amount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity) of [carbon dioxide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) and other [green house gasses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas) being emitted into [the atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth).
Two, we are trying to make the [impacts of climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change), and [pollution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution) and also this [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) shift, less impactful on people, or ideally, a good [thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)) for people so that they like it.
Particularly we would like to decrease the [impacts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change) on the most [disadvantaged people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disadvantaged).
And third – and this is important to [understand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding) anything that's going on here.
This is a [bill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_(law)) that is trying to make [the United States of America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) into an industrial center of the [clean technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_technology) revolution.
Now there are some other smaller [things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)) that are in the [bill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_(law)) that don't fit into any of these categories.
We'll talk about them in [the future](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future), but those are the three big [things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)).
