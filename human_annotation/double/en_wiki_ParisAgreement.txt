[Paris Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement)
[The Paris Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) ([French:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) [Accord de Paris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) ), often referred to as the [Paris Accords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) or the [Paris Climate Accords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement), is an international [treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty) on [climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change).
Adopted in [2015](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015), [the agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) covers [climate change mitigation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation), [adaptation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_adaptation), and [finance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_finance).
[The Paris Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) was negotiated by [196 parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement) at the [2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference) near [Paris, France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris).
As of February [2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023), [195 members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change) of [the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change) are [parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement) to [the agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement).
Of the four [UNFCCC member states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change) which have not [ratified](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification) [the agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement), the only major emitter is [Iran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran).
[The United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) withdrew from [the agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) in [2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020), but rejoined in [2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021).
[The Paris Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) was opened for [signature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature) on [22 April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day) [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016) ([Earth Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day) ) at a [ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremony) in [New York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City).
After [the European Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) [ratified](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification) [the agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement), sufficient [countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) had [ratified](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification) [the agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) responsible for enough of [the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) 's [greenhouse gases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas) for [the agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) to [enter into force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entry_into_force) on [4 November](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_4) [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016).
[The Paris Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) 's long-term [temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature) [goal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal) is to keep the rise in [mean global temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) to well below 2 [°C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius) (3.6 [°F](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit) ) above pre-industrial levels, and preferably [limit the increase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation) to 1.5 [°C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius) (2.7 [°F](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit) ), recognizing that this would substantially [reduce the effects of climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation).
[Emissions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions) should be reduced as soon as possible and reach [net - zero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality) by the middle of the [21st century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century).
To stay below 1.5 [°C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius) of [global warming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change), [emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions) need to be cut by roughly [50%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_half) by 2030.
This is an aggregate of each [country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) 's [nationally determined contributions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationally_determined_contribution).
It aims to help [countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) [adapt to climate change effects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_adaptation), and mobilize enough [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_finance).
Under [the agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement), each [country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) must determine, plan, and regularly report on its [contributions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationally_determined_contribution).
No [mechanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)) forces a [country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) to set specific [emissions targets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_target), but each [target](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_target) should go beyond previous [targets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_target).
In contrast to the [1997 Kyoto Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol), the [distinction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinction_(philosophy)) between [developed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country) and [developing countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country) is blurred, so that the latter also have to submit [plans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan) for [emission reductions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation).
[The agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) was lauded by [world leaders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_heads_of_state_and_government), but [criticized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism) as insufficiently binding by some [environmentalists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalist) and [analysts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyst).
There is [debate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate) about the [effectiveness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy) of [the agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement).
While current pledges under the [Paris Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) are insufficient for reaching the [set temperature goals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_target), there is a [mechanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)) of increased [ambition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation).
[The Paris Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) has been successfully used in [climate litigation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_litigation) [forcing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force) [countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) and an [oil company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry) to strengthen [climate action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_action).
On [4 July](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_4) [2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022), the [Supreme Federal Court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Federal_Court) of [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil) recognized the [Paris agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) as a [human rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights) [treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty).
Development
Lead - up
The [UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change), [adopted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption) at the [1992 Earth Summit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Summit) is one of the first international [treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty) on the [topic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change).
It stipulates that [parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement) should meet regularly to address [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change), at the [Conference of Parties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_of_the_parties) or [COP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_of_the_parties).
It forms the foundation to future [climate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate) [agreements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty).
[The Kyoto Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol), [adopted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption) in [1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997), regulated [greenhouse gas reductions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation) for a limited set of [countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) from [2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008) to [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012).
The [protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty) was extended until [2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020) with the [Doha Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol) in [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012).
[The United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) decided not to [ratify](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification) the [Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol), mainly because of its [legally-binding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability) nature.
This, and [distributional conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_conflict), led to [failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure) of subsequent international [climate negotiations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_climate_change).
The [2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009) [negotiations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_climate_change) were [intended](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention) to produce a successor [treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty) of [Kyoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol), but the [negotiations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_climate_change) collapsed and the resulting [Copenhagen Accord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Accord) was not [legally binding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability) and did not get [adopted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption) [universally](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universality_(philosophy)).
[The Accord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Accord) did lay the [framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change) for bottom-up approach of the [Paris Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement).
Under the [leadership](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership) of [UNFCCC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change) [executive secretary Christiana Figueres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiana_Figueres), [negotiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiation) regained [momentum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum) after [Copenhagen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Accord) 's [failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure).
During the [2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference), the [Durban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durban) Platform was established to [negotiate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiation) a [legal instrument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_instrument) [governing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government) [climate change mitigation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation) [measures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement) from [2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020).
The platform had a mandate to be informed by the [Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC_Fifth_Assessment_Report) and the work of the [subsidiary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary) bodies of the [UNFCCC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change).
The [resulting agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) was to be [adopted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption) in [2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015) .
[Negotiations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiation) and [adoption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption)
[Negotiations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiation) in [Paris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris) took place over a two-week span, and continued throughout the three final [nights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night).
Various [drafts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_document) and proposals had been [debated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate) and streamlined in the preceding year.
According to one commentator two [ways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology) in which the [French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) increased the [likelihood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) of success were: firstly to ensure that [INDCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationally_determined_contribution) were completed before the start of the [negotiations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining), and secondly to invite [leaders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership) just for the beginning of [the conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference).
The [negotiations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_climate_change) almost failed because of a single [word](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word) when [the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) [legal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law) team realized at the last minute that "shall" had been approved, rather than "should", [meaning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics) that [developed countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country) would have been [legally](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure) obliged to cut [emissions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions): the [French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) [solved the problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving) by changing it as a "[typographical error](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_error)".
At the conclusion of [COP21 (the 21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference), on [12 December](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_12) [2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015), the final wording of the [Paris Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) was [adopted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption) [by consensus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making) by the [195 UNFCCC participating member states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change) and [the European Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union).
[Nicaragua](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua) indicated they had wanted to object to the [adoption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption) as they denounced the [weakness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness) of [the agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement), but were not given a [chance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability).
In [the agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) the [members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement) [promised](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promise) to [reduce their carbon output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationally_determined_contribution) "as soon as [possible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_possibility)" and to do their best to keep [global warming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) "to well below 2 [degrees C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius)" (3.6 [°F](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit) ).
[Signing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature) and [entry into force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entry_into_force)
[The Paris Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) was open for [signature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature) by [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) and regional [economic integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_integration) [organizations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization) that are [parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement) to the [UNFCCC (the convention)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change) from [22 April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_22) [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016) to [21 April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_21) [2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_21) at the [UN Headquarters in New York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headquarters_of_the_United_Nations).
[Signing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature) of [the agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) is the first step towards [ratification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification), but it is [possible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_possibility) to accede to [the agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) without [signing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature).
It binds [parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement) to not [act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation) in [contravention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contravention) of the [goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_target) of [the treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement).
On [1 April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_1) [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016), [the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) and [China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China), which represent almost 40% of global [emissions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions) confirmed they would sign the [Paris Climate Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement).
[The agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) was signed by [175 parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement) (174 [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) and the [European Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) ) on the first day it was opened for [signature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature).
As of [March](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March) [2021](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021), 194 [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) and [the European Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) have signed [the agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement).
[The agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) would [enter into force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entry_into_force) (and thus become fully effective) [if](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) 55 [countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) that produce at least 55 [%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point) of [the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) 's [greenhouse gas emissions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions) (according to a list produced in [2015](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015) ) [ratify](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification) or otherwise join [the treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement).
Alternative [ways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology) to join [the treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) are [acceptance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance), [approval](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_and_consent) or accession.
The first two are typically used when a [head of state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state) is not [necessary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need) to bind a [country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) to a [treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty), whereas the latter typically happens when a [country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) joins a [treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty) already in force.
After [ratification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification) by [the European Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union), [the agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) obtained enough [parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) to [enter into effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entry_into_force) on [4 November](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_4) [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016).
Both [the EU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) and [its member states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union) are individually responsible for [ratifying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification) the [Paris Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement).
A strong [preference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference) was reported that [the EU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) and its [28 member states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union) [ratify](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification) at the same time to ensure that they do not engage themselves to fulfilling [obligations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_obligations) that strictly belong to the other, and there were [fears](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear) by observers that [disagreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy) over each [member state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union) 's share of the EU-wide [reduction target](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_target), as well as [Britain 's vote to leave the EU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit) might delay the [Paris pact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement).
However, [the EU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) deposited its instruments of [ratification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification) on [5 October](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_5) [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016), along with seven [EU member states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union).
